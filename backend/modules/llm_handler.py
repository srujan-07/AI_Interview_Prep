    Provide a detailed, multi-part evaluation. You MUST include scores and written analysis for each section.

    **1. Score Breakdown (Format: `Category: [SCORE]/10`)**
    You must provide a score for each of the following:
    - Factual Accuracy: [SCORE]/10
    - Relevance & Directness: [SCORE]/10
    - Structure & Clarity (STAR Method): [SCORE]/10

    **2. Detailed Written Evaluation**
    - **Strengths:** What did the candidate do well? (e.g., "Good use of a specific example...")
    - **Areas for Improvement:** What were the key weaknesses? (e.g., "The result of the action was unclear...")

    **3. Concrete Suggestion**
    - **Example Rephrasing:** Provide a short example of how they could have phrased a key part of their answer more effectively.
